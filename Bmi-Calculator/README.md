# BMI Calculator

This Python program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's weight and height. It classifies the BMI according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standards.

## How it works

- The user inputs their weight (in kg) and height (in meters).
- The program checks if the values are positive.
- It calculates the BMI using the formula:  
  **BMI = weight / (heightÂ²)**
- Displays the BMI value with two decimal places.
- Shows the BMI classification based on WHO guidelines.
- Asks the user if they want to perform another calculation.
- Repeats until the user chooses to exit.
