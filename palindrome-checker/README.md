# Palindrome Checker

This Python project allows the user to input words and checks whether they are **palindromes** â€” words that read the same backward as forward.

## How it works

- The program asks the user to enter a word.
- It strips spaces and converts the word to lowercase.
- It checks if the word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version.
- If it is, it confirms and stores the word in a list of palindromes.
- Asks the user if they want to enter another word.
- Repeats the process until the user chooses to exit.
- At the end, it displays all detected palindromes.

```bash
python palindrome-checker.py
