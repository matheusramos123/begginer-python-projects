# 04-Number-guessing-game

## Description

This is a simple game where the computer chooses a random number between 1 and 10, and you have to guess what it is. After each guess, the game tells you if the machine's number is higher or lower than your guess, until you get it right.

> **Note:** For now, the game **does not handle input errors**. That means if you type something other than an integer between 1 and 10, the program might crash. I'm still learning how to add this!
